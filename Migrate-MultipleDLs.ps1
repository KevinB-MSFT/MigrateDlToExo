# This script will prompt for a DL name, read the DL settings from AD, update it it's AD object so AADC will no longer sync it, runs an AADC sync, and re-create the DL as a net-new DL in EXO
#
# It's best to run this script on the AADC server so it can trigger an AADC sync
# Reguires Exchnage Online and Active Directory PowerShell module already installed on the machine running the script
# Script should be ran with an account that has rights to run an AADC sync and modify the Dl's AD properties.
